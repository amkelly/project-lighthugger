# project-lighthugger
A web-based game about space. A vehicle for teaching myself some javascript or some other framework or language.

Currently planning to build the project in Love2d.

Concept: 
The player is one of a number of interstellar travellers in cryogenic sleep/virtual hybernation aboard a "lighthugger or sleepership" (apologies to Alistriar Reynolds), a ship that accellerates to a fraction of _c_ en-route to its destination
